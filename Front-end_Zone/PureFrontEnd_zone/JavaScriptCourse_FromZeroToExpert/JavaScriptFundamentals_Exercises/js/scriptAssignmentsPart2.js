      represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of

      store the results into variables, and log them to the console

2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of 
   your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array 
3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from 
   the end of the array 
4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the 
   console: 'Probably not a central European country :D' 
5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the 
   index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to 
   change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 
   'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.`;
